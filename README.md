# fastroute-code
Basic illustration of FastRoute implementation to create routing for a web app

[FastRoute library link](https://github.com/nikic/fastroute)

Usage: 
    index.php has the basic code, for seperating routes, use the routes folder to add seperate routes

    If you use Apache server, you need to enable <Directory /var/www/html> Allowoverride all </Directory> in 
    ```/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf```

    For Nginx, you have to allow something similar to that
